# ShinyApp_Canadian-Climate-Change-Discovery
This a web shiny app (R, JSON) to show the Canadian climate change based on the datasets from Government of Canada. 

To run the whole program, you need a platform to load and I suggest using Cyberduck if you are MAC users.
A live presentation of my program can be viewd at:  https://shiny.rcg.sfu.ca/u/zwa117/myapp/
